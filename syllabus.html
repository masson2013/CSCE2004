	<h1>Goal</h1>
	<menu>

	<p>The goal of this class is to develop fundamental
	computer-based problem solving skills in the following areas:

	</p><ol>
	<li>Software Development - The specification, design, implementation, testing,
	and documentation of software to solve specific problems. 

	</li><li>Structured Programming - The syntax, semantics, and use of the basic
	features of a typical structured programming language (e.g., loops, conditionals, functions).

	</li><li>Algorithms and Data Structures - Basic methods for storing and 
	manipulating data to effectively solve specific problems (e.g., arrays, binary search).

	</li><li>Object Oriented Programming - The syntax, semantics, and use of the basic
	features of a typical object-oriented programming language (e.g., C++).
	</li></ol>

	<p>The pedagogical approach will be focused on solving problems using
	existing software modules (e.g., class libraries) and new modules when
	necessary. The syntax and semantics of programming language constructs will
	be introduced as needed in this context. Labs will reinforce concepts taught
	in the lecture and also introduce students to the Linux operating system.
	</p>

	<h1>Grading</h1>
	

	<p>Final grades in this class will be determined by a weighted average
	of lab grades, programming project grades, quizzes, and exam scores. We will use
	the following scale to assign final grades:
	</p>
	<menu>
	<ul>
	<li>A: over  90%</li>
	<li>B: 80% - 89%</li>
	<li>C: 70% - 79%</li>
	<li>D: 60% - 69%</li>
	<li>F: below 60%</li>
	</ul>
	</menu>


	<p>Students must pass BOTH the homework portion of the class (labs and projects) 
	AND the exam portion (midterms and final) with a grade of D or better in order 
	to pass this course. Hence, an overall average greater than 60% may still result in 
	a failure in some cases. The grade will be calculated as follows:

	</p><menu><ul>
	<li>Quizzes: 10%</li>
	<li>Labs: 10%</li>
	<li>Programming Projects: 40%</li>
	<li>Midterm: 15%</li>
	<li>Final Exam: 25%</li>
	</ul></menu>

	<p><h2>Quizzes:</h2> <p>
	There will be short, in-class programming quizzes frequently throughout the semester. 
	These quizzes will be used to take attendance in class and get student
	feedback on materials covered in class. Students need to solve a programming problem on
	the computer and demonstrate the result to the TA or Instructor.

	</p><h2>Labs:</h2> 
	<p>
	There will be weekly laboratory assignments.
	Grades for the labs will be based on completeness, correctness, and effort.
	Although lab materials are available on the web and can be submitted
	electronically, students are required to attend labs and demonstrate the program
	to TA or Instructor. 

	</p><h2>Programming Projects:</h2> <p>
	There also will be 6-8 relatively large programming projects that 
	will integrate material taught in the course. The project requirements
	and due dates will be posted on the class website.
	The programming projects will be graded according to the following scale:

	</p><menu><ul>
	<li>50% program correctness</li>
	<li>20% software design</li>
	<li>10% programming style</li>
	<li>10% testing</li>
	<li>10% documentation</li>
	</ul></menu>

	<p>Programming projects must be submitted electronically by midnight of 
	the due date specified in the project description. Projects which are 
	submitted after the due date lose 10% per day for up to 3 days late. 
	Projects more than 3 days late will not be accepted and will receive
	a grade of ZERO. Weekends count as 1 day. Partial credit will be given 
	for programs which compile but which are not complete. Starting early on 
	programming projects is strongly encouraged.

	</p><h2>Exams:</h2><p>
	There will be two exams in this class. One midterm exam and a 
	comprehensive final exam. All exams will be closed book, but each student 
	will be allowed to bring in a single 8.5 by 11 sheet of notes. 
	Calculators will not be needed or allowed. Make up exams will only be 
	allowed under exceptional circumstances (e.g., a note from your doctor).

	</p>


<h1>ADA Statement</h1>
<p>If any member of the class has a documented disability and needs 
special accommodations, the instructor will work with the student to 
provide reasonable accommodation to ensure the student a fair opportunity 
to perform in this class. Please advise the instructor of the disability 
and the desired accommodations within the first week of the semester.
